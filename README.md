# ForgeGrid üî•

**ForgeGrid** is a **gamified Java desktop application** that transforms coding practice into an RPG-style, task-based leveling journey for learners. Users complete challenges, earn XP, level up, and track their skill progression ‚Äî all while staying engaged with daily tasks.

---

## Project Overview

ForgeGrid is built with **Java Swing** and follows a modular architecture to provide a smooth user experience. The app assigns coding tasks based on the player‚Äôs current level and enforces **timed challenges**. Completing tasks rewards XP, while skipping or missing deadlines may reduce XP. Users can also create custom challenges (‚ÄúGoated Tasks‚Äù) with self-set deadlines.

ForgeGrid combines **progression, gamification, and engagement** into a single platform that encourages daily learning.

## Key Features

### Player System
- Tracks: **Name, Level, XP, Rank, Streak**
- Automatically updates stats as tasks are completed

### Task System
- **Assign Tasks**: Auto-assigned based on level
- **Submit / Skip Tasks**: Track progress and XP changes
- **Custom Tasks**: Add personal ‚ÄúGoated Tasks‚Äù with deadlines

### Timed Challenges

- Early completion unlocks the next challenge immediately

### XP & Leveling
- Gain XP for completed tasks
- Lose XP for skipped/missed tasks
- Level up to unlock harder challenges

### Persistent Data
