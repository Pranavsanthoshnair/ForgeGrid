# ForgeGrid üî•

**ForgeGrid** is a **gamified Java desktop application** that transforms coding practice into an RPG-style, task-based leveling journey for learners. Users complete challenges, earn XP, level up, and track their skill progression ‚Äî all while staying engaged with daily tasks.

---

## Project Overview

ForgeGrid is built with **Java Swing** and follows a modular architecture to provide a smooth user experience. The app assigns coding tasks based on the player‚Äôs current level and enforces **timed challenges**. Completing tasks rewards XP, while skipping or missing deadlines may reduce XP. Users can also create custom challenges (‚ÄúGoated Tasks‚Äù) with self-set deadlines.

ForgeGrid combines **progression, gamification, and engagement** into a single platform that encourages daily learning.

## Technology Stack
- **Java JDK 17+**
- **Swing GUI**: JFrame, JTable, JButton, JLabel, JProgressBar
- **MySQL Database** for data persistence
- **Collections**: ArrayList, HashMap for task management

---

## Installation & Setup
1. Install **Java JDK 17 or higher** (recommended: Java 17 LTS for best compatibility)
2. Install **XAMPP** and start MySQL service
3. **Setup Database**: Run `database/forgegrid_schema.sql` in phpMyAdmin to create the database before launching the app
4. Clone or download the project repository
5. **Build the project**: Run `build.bat` (Windows) or `build.sh` (Linux/Mac)
6. Open in an IDE (**VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse**)
7. **Run the application**: Right-click on `Main.java` ‚Üí "Run Java" or use the IDE's run button

**Note:** The project uses MySQL for data persistence and requires the MySQL connector JAR in the `lib/` folder to be included in the classpath. Most IDEs will handle this automatically.
8. Progress is automatically saved to the MySQL database (`forgegrid`)
