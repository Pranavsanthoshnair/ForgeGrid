# Popup Task System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 New Design Overview

Complete redesign from "task list" to "one task at a time" popup system with automatic timer tracking.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Task Popup Dialog**
When user clicks "▶ Start Next Task" button:
- Opens a modal popup showing ONE task at a time
- **Auto-timer starts immediately** (no manual time input!)
- Shows task details:
  - 📋 Task name
  - 📝 Full description
  - 💻 Programming language
  - 📚 Skill level
  - ⭐ XP reward
  - ⏱ Estimated time
- Live timer display (updates every second): `⏱ 00:00`

### 2. **Automatic Timer System**
- ✅ Timer starts when popup opens
- ✅ Runs in background (no user interaction needed)
- ✅ Displays in `MM:SS` format
- ✅ Tracks elapsed time automatically
- ✅ Validates completion time vs estimated time

### 3. **Task Completion (Submit)**
- User clicks "✓ Submit Task" when done
- System automatically checks:
  - If completed too quickly (< 10% of estimated time)
  - Shows warning if suspicious timing
  - Asks for confirmation
- On valid submission:
  - Saves completion to database
  - Awards full XP (e.g., +20 XP)
  - Updates user's score
  - Shows success message
  - **Prompts: "Start next task?" or "Return to Dashboard"**
  - If user chooses "Next Task", automatically shows next popup

### 4. **Task Skipping**
- User clicks "⏭ Skip Task" to skip
- Shows confirmation dialog:
  - "Skip this task?"
  - "⚠️ You will lose 50% of the XP (X XP penalty)"
- On confirmation:
  - Saves as "skipped" in database
  - Applies 50% XP penalty (negative XP)
  - Updates user's score
  - Shows result message
  - **Prompts: "Start next task?" or "Return to Dashboard"**

### 5. **Task History Panel**
Instead of showing hardcoded tasks, the Tasks view now shows:
- **Header**: "Task Center" with "▶ Start Next Task" button
- **Real Task History**: Recent completed/skipped tasks
- Each history card shows:
  - Task name
  - Time taken (in minutes)
  - Relative timestamp (e.g., "5 min ago", "2 hours ago")
  - XP gained or lost (+20 XP or -10 XP)
  - Status icon:
    - ✓ = Completed (green border)
    - ⏭ = Skipped (orange border)
- Color-coded XP:
  - Green for positive XP (completed)
  - Red for negative XP (skipped)

### 6. **Time Validation**
- Prevents too-quick submissions
- Example:
  - Task: "Simple Calculator" (est. 30 min)
  - User submits after 2 min
  - System shows warning:
    - "You completed this task very quickly (2 min)!"
    - "Expected time: 30 min."
    - "Are you sure you want to submit?"
  - User can cancel and continue working

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Task Popup Design:
- Modal dialog (600x500px)
- Dark theme matching main app
- Live timer in header (updates every second)
- Clean, card-based layout
- Color-coded metadata:
  - 💻 Language (white)
  - 📚 Level (white)
  - ⭐ XP (gold)
  - ⏱ Time (blue)
- Warning text: "⚠️ Timer is tracking your work..."
- Two action buttons:
  - "✓ Submit Task" (green)
  - "⏭ Skip Task" (orange)

### Task History Design:
- Card-based history entries
- Color-coded borders:
  - Green for completed tasks
  - Orange for skipped tasks
- Scrollable list

## 🔄 User Flow

### Complete Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Tasks" in sidebar
2. Sees task history panel
3. Clicks "▶ Start Next Task"
4. Popup opens with first uncompleted task
5. Timer starts automatically (00:00, 00:01, 00:02...)
6. User works on the task
7. User clicks "✓ Submit Task"
8. System validates time
9. Awards XP, saves to database
10. Shows "🎉 Task completed! +20 XP! Start next task?"
11. User clicks "Next Task"
12. Popup reopens with next uncompleted task
13. Repeat until all tasks complete
```

### Skip Flow:
```
1. User working on task
2. Decides to skip
3. Clicks "⏭ Skip Task"
4. Confirms: "Yes, lose 50% XP"
5. System applies penalty (-10 XP)
6. Shows "⏭ Task skipped. -10 XP. Start next task?"
7. User can continue with next task
```

## 💾 Database Changes

### user_tasks Table:
- **status** column now supports:
  - `'completed'` - Task fully completed (full XP)
  - `'skipped'` - Task skipped (50% XP penalty)
- **xp_earned** column can be:
  - Positive (completed tasks)
  - Negative (skipped tasks)

### New Methods in HardcodedTaskService:
```java
// Save skipped task with negative XP
public boolean saveSkippedTask(String username, String taskName, 
                                int timeTaken, int xpLost)

// Get task history (last N tasks)
public List<TaskHistoryEntry> getTaskHistory(String username, int limit)
```

## 📋 New Classes

### 1. TaskHistoryEntry
```java
package com.forgegrid.model;

public class TaskHistoryEntry {
    public String taskName;
    public int timeTaken;
    public int xpEarned;    // Can be negative for skipped tasks
    public String status;    // "completed" or "skipped"
    public String timestamp; // Relative time string
}
```

### 2. TaskPopupDialog
```java
package com.forgegrid.ui;

public class TaskPopupDialog extends JDialog {
    - Shows one task at a time
    - Auto-timer with live updates
    - Submit button (validates time)
    - Skip button (50% XP penalty)
    - Prompts for next action after completion/skip
}
```
