## ForgeGrid User Manual

### Overview
ForgeGrid helps you learn and track progress through an elegant desktop UI. You’ll authenticate, complete a short onboarding, and use the dashboard to access views like Assigned Tasks, Progress, and Settings.

### Launching the App
- Windows: double‑click `run.bat` (or run it from a terminal)
- macOS/Linux: run `./build.sh` once, then start from your IDE or `java` (see technical guide)

### Authentication
1. Open ForgeGrid. The title bar shows “ForgeGrid”.
2. On the welcome screen, click “Let’s start” to go to Login.
3. Login
   - Enter username/email and password.
   - Press Enter or click “Login”.
   - “Forgot Password?” lets you reset if you remember your username.
4. Sign Up
   - Switch via “New User? Sign Up”.
   - Provide Username, Email, and Password, then click “Sign Up”.

Tips
- The username you successfully use is remembered and suggested next time.
- Placeholders clear when you start typing.

### Onboarding (one‑time, takes <1 minute)
After first login, you’ll answer 3 quick questions:
- Your primary goal (e.g., fundamentals, interviews, competitive, projects)
- Preferred language (Java, Python, C, JavaScript)
- Current skill level (Beginner → Expert)

When you finish, your choices are saved and immediately applied to the Dashboard. Returning users who completed onboarding go straight to Dashboard.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard window has three main areas:
- Top bar: shows your Username, Level, XP bar, Rank, and Streak.
- Left sidebar: a tree menu to navigate views.
- Center area: the active view content.

Views
- Dashboard: overview landing (future widgets appear here).
- Assigned Tasks: tasks queued for you.
- Completed Tasks: history of finished work.
- Skipped/Missed: things you skipped.
- Goated Tasks: your favorites or highlights.
- Profile: personal information and preferences.
- Achievements: milestones you earn over time.
- Progress Tracker: broader view of XP and levels.
- Deadline Tracker: time‑bound items and reminders.
- Save/Load Progress: persistence operations.
- Settings: app preferences.
- Help & Docs: guidance and support links.
- Exit: cleanly close the app.

How to Navigate
- Click items in the sidebar (leaf nodes) to switch the center view.
- Use the window controls to resize; UI scales to maintain readability.

### Loading Screen
- After login (especially for returning users), a short loading screen appears with a wheel animation and rotating status messages. You can “spin” the wheel while waiting.

### Offline Indicator (if present)
- If your machine goes offline, an indicator may appear to warn you. Some features may be limited until the connection returns.

### Troubleshooting
- Incorrect credentials: you’ll be prompted to retry.
- Password reset: use “Forgot Password?” on the login card.
- Window too small: resize; UI components scale to remain readable.
